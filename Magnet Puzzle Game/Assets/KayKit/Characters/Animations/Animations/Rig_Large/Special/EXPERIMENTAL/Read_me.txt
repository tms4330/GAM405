The animations tagged as "EXPERIMENTAL" may not work as intended in on Humanoid rigs at the moment.
To work with these animations you can try setting the rig type to 'Generic' for both the animation and character you want to use them with.

A more elegant solution for this is in the works and will be added at a later date. Thanks for your understanding
